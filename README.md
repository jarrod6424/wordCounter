# wordCounter

I used Jetbrains IntelliJ / Java for my IDE / language.
I zipped the project, built an executable jar, and uploaded both to this repo.
In order to run the project, download the jar and run it.

The URL is localhost:8080/counter

I have the values defaulted to id=1&message=demo

If you want to add more to the counter, the URL is localhost:8080/counter?id=<int>&message=<string>

Due to the hustle/bustle of thanksgiving/black friday, I didn't get a chance to start on this until late Tuesday night 
and spent more time creating a github account/uploading the project than actually doing the project.
